Pixel Positions is a beginner's full stack application to learn the basics of the Laravel framework. This is the final project taught by Jeffry Way to help solidify our skills! :smile:

I also used this repo as a way to practice [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), which will make my commits easier to understand and more professional!

Check out the [Laravel framework](https://laravel.com).
